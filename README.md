🛒 Discount Verifier Program (Python)

This program is designed to help determine whether a store discount is real, moderate, or misleading by comparing the original price, the displayed current price, and an applied coupon percentage.

Many stores advertise discounts that appear attractive but do not represent a meaningful saving. This script calculates the real discount percentage, the final price, and the actual savings, allowing users to identify genuine offers.

⚙️ How It Works

The program asks the user to input:

The original price of the product

The current displayed price

The coupon percentage

Using this data, it:

Moderate Offer

Fake or Trivial Discount (price manipulation or very low savings)
